Creating mapping rules is how you translate your relational tables into
MongoDB collections. You can create mapping rules from either the 
:guilabel:`Relational` or :guilabel:`MongoDB` headers of the schema model pane.

About this Task
---------------

Options available on the :guilabel:`Add mapping` pane depend on the type of 
mapping rule you are adding. For a full overview of each mapping rule 
option see:

- :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>`

- :ref:`Embedded Array <rm-embedded-array>`

- :ref:`Embedded documents <rm-embedded-documents>`

You can also create mapping rules based on a destination MongoDB model. For more 
information, see :ref:`Create Rule from Relational <create-rule-relational>`.

Steps
-----

1. Open a project.

#. In the left :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, click on a collection under the 
   :guilabel:`MongoDB` header. 
   
   This prompts the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane to open on the right of the screen.

#. On the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane, click :guilabel:`+ Add` to create a new mapping rule.

#. Select the name of the source table from the drop-down.

#. Define the options for the new mapping rule.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.
