   * - Deployment Model

     - Description

   * - Local

     - Suitable for evaluation and proof of concept jobs. 

       For more information, see :ref:`Install on a Single Machine 
       <single-machine-install>`. 

   * - Unattended server

     - Suitable for smaller production jobs. 
       
       For more information, see :ref:`Install on an Unattended Server 
       <unattended-server>`. 

   * - Docker

     - Suitable if your familiar with Docker and don't want to run 
       Relational Migrator directly on a server or machine.

     - :ref:`Install with Docker <rm-install-docker>`

   * - Kafka

     - The Kafka deployment method is recommended for long-running Change Data 
       Capture (CDC) syncs and large data migrations of more than 20GB. Apache Kafka 
       is an open-source platform for distributed workloads that offers high 
       availability and automatic recovery. This option is the most advanced, and is 
       intended for users who require long-running or large production data syncs. 
       
       For more information, see :ref:`kafka-intro`.

   * - Kafka with Confluent Cloud

     - The Kafka with Confluent Cloud deployment method is an option for users who 
       want the reliability of Kafka without having to manage their own cluster. 
       Confluent is a fully-managed Kafka hosting provider run by the founders of 
       Kafka. This deployment method uses APIs to add the newest Relational Migrator 
       sink connectors to Confluent Cloud as managed connectors.

       For more information, see :ref:`install-confluent-kafka`.
