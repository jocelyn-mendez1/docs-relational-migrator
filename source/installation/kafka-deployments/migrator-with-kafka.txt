You can use Relational Migrator to migrate data to and from Kafka. 
Relational Migrator can be used as a Kafka Connect plug-in that improves 
resilience and scalability of big data migration jobs.

Use Cases
---------

Relational Migrator with Kafka is intended for large and long running jobs. 
It provides increased resilience and scalability for your long running migration jobs.

Behavior
--------

Relational Migrator works with Kafka as a Kafka Connect sink connector. A 
`Debezium connector <https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/index.html>`__ 
extracts data from a SQL database and is an event source. Relational Migrator 
interprets and transforms events from the Debezium source and sends them to a 
MongoDB cluster which acts as a data sink.

Tasks
-----

You can use the following deployment methods to install Relational Migrator 
with Kafka:

   * - :ref:`Install with Existing Kafka Cluster <install-kafka-cluster>`

     - This deployment method is ideal if you are already running Kafka or 
       have your own approach to installing and configuring Kafka.

   * - :ref:`Install with a Containerized Cluster using Docker <install-docker>`

     - This deployment method is ideal for educational purposes. Use this if you 
       are looking to learn and understand how to configure your own multi-server Kafka
       environment.

   * - :ref:`Install with Confluent Cloud <install-confluent-kafka>`
     - This deployment method is ideal if you want the reliability of Kafka without 
       having to manage your own cluster.
