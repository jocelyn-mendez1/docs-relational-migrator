You can install Relational Migrator with Kafka using Confluent Cloud. This 
deployment method provides the reliability of Kafka without having you manage 
your own Kafka cluster. 

Before you Begin
----------------

Due to restrictions by Confluent, you are only able to use basic, standard, and 
dedicated cluster. For most use case, the basic and standard cluster are enough 
to handle moving large volumes of data.

   .. step:: Create a Confluent Cloud environment

      Go to `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/>`__ and create a new environment. 

   .. step:: Enable schema registry

      Enable schema registry and select a region.

      If you have more than 1000 tables being migrated, use the Advanced schema registry tier.
      Otherwise, the Essentials tier is adequate. 

   .. step:: Create a cluster

      For most use cases, the Basic and Standard tier clusters are enough. If you are moving large 
      volumes of data, consider the Dedicated cluster tier.
