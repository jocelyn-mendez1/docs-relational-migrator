You can use Relational Migrator to migrate data to and from Kafka. 
Relational Migrator can be used as a Kafka Connect plug-in that improves 
resilience and scalability of big data migration jobs.

Use Cases
---------

Relational Migrator with Kafka is intended for large migration jobs that normally
require long run times. By using Relational Migrator with Kafka, you help reduce 
migration times. 

Behavior
--------

Relational Migrator works with Kafka as a Kafka Connect sink connector. A 
`Debezium connector <https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/index.html>`__ 
extracts data from a SQL database and is an event source. Relational Migrator 
interprets and transforms events from the Debezium source and sends them to a 
MongoDB cluster which acts as a data sink.

Relational Migrator is not packaged with Kafka Connect. To use Relational Migrator 
with Kafka you have to install Relational Manager and integrate it with your 
Kafka cluster. To set up the Kafka Connect cluster, configure the following 
components:

- `Apache Zookeeper <https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.8.0/zookeeperOver.html>`__

- `Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/>`__

- (Optional) `Schema Registry <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/schema_registry_tutorial.html>`__

Tasks
-----

You can install Relational Migrator with Kafka in the following ways:

- :ref:`Install with Existing Kafka Cluster <install-kafka-cluster>`

  Install with an existing Kafka cluster if you are already running Kafka or 
  have your own approach to installing and configuring Kafka.

- :ref:`Install with Docker <install-docker>`

  Install with Docker if you are using a containerized cluster. 

- :ref:`Install with Kubernetes <install-kubernetes>`

  Install with Kubernetes if you need a production-scale option and have experience 
  with Kubernetes.
