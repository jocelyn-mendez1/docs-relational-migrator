You can stop a sync job from the :guilabel:`Job Overview` pane on the 
:guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

About this Task
---------------

The effects of stopping a sync job on your destination database depend on 
the type and stage of the sync job:

- If you stop a snapshot sync job during the snapshot stage, any 
  partially migrated data remains in the MongoDB database.
- If you stop a continuous sync job during the CDC stage, the process 
  ends gracefully, and Relational Migrator cleans up any temporary data.

Once initiated, the process of canceling or completing a sync job may take up to one minute.

Steps
-----

To stop your sync job, follow the instructions below based on the current stage of execution:

      tabs:

         - id: stop-snapshot
           name: Stop a Sync Job in Snapshot stage

              #. Open the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.
              #. Click on the sync job in the :guilabel:`History` pane.

              #. Click the red :guilabel:`Terminate` button on the pop-up modal.
                 Once a sync job cancels, an :guilabel:`x` icon displays 
                 in the :guilabel:`History` pane, and the status of the sync
                 job updates to :guilabel:`Snapshot cancelled`.

         - id: stop-cdc
           name: Stop a Sync Job in CDC stage
           content: |
              #. Open the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.
              #. Click on the sync job in the :guilabel:`History` pane.
              #. Click the :guilabel:`Complete CDC`  button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
              #. Click the green :guilabel:`Complete CDC` button on the pop-up modal.
                 Once the sync job completes, a checkmark icon displays in the :guilabel:`History` pane, all stages display a status of :guilabel:`COMPLETED`, and the status of the sync job updates to :guilabel:`CDC completed`.
