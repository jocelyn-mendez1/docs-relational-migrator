Sync Jobs
=========

Sync jobs transfer data from your relational database to MongoDB. Sync 
jobs use project-level :ref:`rm-mapping-rules` to distribute data to 
your MongoDB database.

Types of Sync Jobs
------------------

Relational Migrator offers two different sync job types:

**Snapshot**: Snapshot sync jobs run once, typically for a point in time 
migration strategy.

**Continuous**: Continuous sync jobs cover new incoming data for a zero-downtime 
Change Data Capture (CDC) migration strategy. Continuous jobs run a snapshot stage first,
followed by a CDC stage that captures database updates in near-real time. 
When you run a continuous sync job, your source and destination database 
data remain in sync.

.. note:: Private Preview : Kafka Deployment Model

   The Kafka deployment model of Relational Migrator allows you to run 
   longer-running snapshot or continuous sync jobs with improved resiliency. 
   This model is currently available in private preview. If you are interested
   in learning about or testing this model, please contact your MongoDB account team.
